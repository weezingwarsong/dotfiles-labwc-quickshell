## UI terminology

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Module** | A single view loaded into the main pill — e.g. *time*, *workspace indicator*, *MPRIS*, *window switcher*, *recording status*. Only one module is active at a time. |
| **Main pill** | The always-visible `Style.pillHeight` (24 px) bar element at the top-centre. Swaps its module based on context (recording > workspace flash > MPRIS > time) or on demand (window switcher via `Super+Tab`). |
| **Panel** | A container that spawns below the main pill on demand or on hover — e.g. the window list, the MPRIS player panel, the calendar. Panels are dismissed when the module changes or the user presses Escape. |

These names are also reflected in `Style.qml` token prefixes:
- `pill*` — background, border, height for the main pill
- `panel*` — background, border for spawned panels; `panelButton*` for interactive rows inside panels
- `textPill*` — text colours inside the main pill
- `textPanel*` — text colours inside spawned panels

## Features

**Single-slot bar** — one rigid rectangular bar at the top-center. The bar itself never moves or resizes; only one module's content is shown at a time, and switching between them rolls the outgoing text/icon out one edge while the incoming one rolls in from the other — like text printed on a cylinder rotating behind the bar. Priority order: forced keybind (window switcher / calendar / MPRIS, whichever was invoked last — mutually exclusive with each other) > recording > workspace flash > MPRIS (background/hover) > time. See `_forcedPinPriority`/`_setWindowActive`/`_setCalendarPinned`/`_setMprisPinned` in `shell.qml`.

**Time module** — shows the current time in `HHmm` format. Hovering slides down a wide calendar panel (independent panel width — see `_panelWidthFrac` in `shell.qml`; the pill itself never resizes); the panel stays open as long as the mouse is anywhere over the pill+panel region, not just the pill itself. Hovering continuously for 30s pins it open permanently (a thumbtack button appears to unpin). `Super+1` force-opens it directly, independent of hover, dismissing whichever other panel was pinned/active; Escape (once pinned) closes it again.
- **Agenda** (left) — today's events pulled from `gcal-fetch`, split into all-day and timed, with tooltips on truncated titles.
- **Month view** (middle) — navigable via prev/next triangle buttons or a month/year picker (click the month/year label; it inline-swaps to a year+month grid rather than a floating popup, since a fixed-size Wayland layer-shell surface has no "outside the window" for an overlay to render into). Days with events are highlighted with a tooltip listing them; today gets a hover-grow button treatment and, when the picker is open, the label becomes a "Today" shortcut back to the current month.
- **Weather** (below month view) — current temperature, condition, today's high/low, and a day/night Nerd Font weather glyph (nf-weather), pulled from `weather-fetch`. Location is auto-detected via IP geolocation (cached 24h) and weather data comes from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) — both keyless, no account/credentials setup needed.
- **Button rail** (right) — settings (inert, pending the Settings roadmap item), open-in-browser (`xdg-open` to Google Calendar), and a reserved placeholder.

**Workspace module** — two filled squares representing workspaces 1 and 2. Active is Nord7, inactive is Nord3. Flashes for 1 second on switch then returns to the resting module.

**MPRIS module** — becomes the bar's priority winner for as long as a track is actually playing, but the bar itself no longer auto-opens for the whole song: each track change instead fires a desktop notification (title/artist, via `notify-send`/mako) announcing it, independent of whatever the bar currently shows. Hovering the bar at any point mid-song reveals the live player panel (album, playback controls, a focus button that brings the player window to front) on demand; moving away hides it again without affecting playback. Hovering continuously for 30s pins it open permanently (thumbtack button to unpin), and `Super+2` force-opens/closes it directly — either way dismissing whichever other panel was pinned/active, with Escape closing it again once pinned. Once playback actually stops/pauses, releases ~1s after you stop hovering it.

**Calendar sync** — `helper/calendar/gcal_fetch.py` (installed as `gcal-fetch` on `PATH`) pulls Google Calendar events via OAuth and prints JSON; quickshell polls it every 5 minutes and caches the result client-side (window: -3 months to +24 months), so month navigation in the Time module never triggers a network call. Fetch mode never opens a browser — on auth failure it notifies (currently via `scripts/gcal-notify.sh`, a `notify-send` wrapper) and exits; re-auth is `gcal-fetch --auth`, run by hand. Credentials (`~/.config/gcal-quickshell/credentials.json` + cached `token.json`) live outside the repo, since it's public on GitHub.

**Window switcher** — `Super+Tab` opens a panel with all open windows in a flat list, a live filter input, and full keyboard navigation (Up/Down to move, Enter to focus, Escape or Super+Tab to dismiss). Force-opens to the top of the bar regardless of what's currently showing (recording included) and dismisses whichever other panel was pinned/active, same as the calendar/MPRIS keybinds. The currently focused window is shown muted. Powered by `qs-watcher`, a native C binary that listens to `zwlr_foreign_toplevel_manager_v1` — window list and active-window state update in real time with no polling.

**Recording module** — `Super+Shift+R` starts screen recording. The bar switches to "RECORDING" (Nord11 red). On stop, shows "RECORDING SAVED" (Nord14 green) for 1 second, then returns to the resting module. Recordings saved to `~/Videos/`.

**Wallpaper** — images dropped into `quickshell/wallpaper/` are sorted alphabetically and assigned to workspaces in order. Passes all pointer input through to the compositor.

**Notifications** — mako handles desktop notifications with the Nord palette at 90% opacity, matching the quickshell aesthetic.

**Native Wayland IPC** — no polling anywhere. A single C binary (`qs-watcher`) binds directly to compositor protocols:
- `zwlr_foreign_toplevel_manager_v1` — tracks all open windows and their state
- `ext_workspace_manager_v1` — tracks the active workspace name

Emits one compact JSON line per state change to stdout. quickshell spawns `qs-watcher` directly as a child process so its output flows straight into the parser with no FIFO in the middle. `start-watchers.sh` (called from autostart before quickshell) evicts any leftover watcher from a previous session. If the compositor disconnects (e.g. `labwc --reconfigure`), the watcher exits and quickshell respawns it after 2 s.

# AUR
yay -S \
    quickshell \
    nordzy-cursors \
    papirus-nord \
    rofi-polkit-agent
```

### 2 — Clone and install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/weezingwarsong/dotfiles-labwc-quickshell.git ~/Projects/github/dotfiles-labwc-quickshell
cd ~/Projects/github/dotfiles-labwc-quickshell
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` will:
- Symlink `labwc/`, `quickshell/`, `mako/`, `rofi/` and `scripts/` into `~/.config/`
- Compile `helper/watcher/main.c` → `~/.local/bin/qs-watcher`
- Install labwc menu icons to `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/`

> `~/.local/bin` is added to `PATH` via `labwc/environment` so `qs-watcher` is found by quickshell. No manual PATH setup required.

### 3 — Wallpapers

Drop image files into `~/.config/quickshell/wallpaper/`. They are assigned to workspaces alphabetically — rename files to control the order (e.g. `1-mountains.jpg`, `2-forest.png`).

Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, SVG, GIF (animated), and video formats (WebM, MP4, etc.) via `qt6-multimedia`.

## Roadmap / To-do

- [x] **Calendar panel** — see the "Time module" and "Calendar sync" entries under Features above for the full shape of what's built: agenda, navigable month view + inline picker, event highlighting/tooltips, button rail, and the `gcal-fetch` backend wired into `shell.qml` as a periodic `Process`.
  > OAuth credentials (`~/.config/gcal-quickshell/credentials.json`, from Google Cloud Console) and the cached `token.json` live outside the repo — it's public on GitHub — so they're never committed and aren't part of `install.sh`; set up by hand per-machine with `gcal-fetch --auth`.
  - [x] Weather box — wired to `weather-fetch` (Open-Meteo + IP geolocation, both keyless), including a day/night Nerd Font condition icon mapped from the WMO weather code. See the "Weather" entry under Features above and `helper/weather/weather_fetch.py`.
  - [ ] Force calendar sync — a way to trigger an immediate `gcal-fetch` poll (button in the calendar panel and/or a keybind) instead of waiting out the 5-minute periodic timer, for right-after-you-just-added-an-event cases.

- [ ] **Settings component** — a quickshell module (triggered by a keybind, and by the currently-inert settings button in the calendar panel's button rail) for configuring user preferences at runtime without editing files. Candidates:
  - [ ] **Default apps** — replace hardcoded app references (e.g. `kitty` as terminal, the `focus-or-open.sh` app\_id mappings for `W-w`/browser and `W-e`/file manager) with `xdg-open` and XDG MIME defaults, so swapping preferred apps doesn't require touching `rc.xml` or scripts by hand.
  - [ ] **Wallpaper management** — browse and assign wallpapers to workspaces from the UI rather than by manually dropping files into the wallpaper folder with carefully sorted filenames.
  - [ ] **Theme editor** — runtime overrides for the per-element color, opacity, and corner-radius tokens in `Style.qml` (pill, panel, panel-button, tooltip). `Style.qml` stays the shipped "default/reset" baseline — user overrides get written to a separate document (not this file) that the panel can save/load, rather than mutating `Style.qml` directly.

  Settings would write to a small config document that the scripts and shell read.

- [ ] **Panel open/close animation** — animate the expanded panels (MPRIS player, window switcher, calendar) to grow/shrink in height when they open/close, mirroring the bar's vertical roll transition instead of popping open instantly.

- [x] **Escape-to-dismiss for pinned panels** — window switcher, calendar (once pinned), and MPRIS (once pinned) all grab exclusive per-surface keyboard focus (`WlrLayershell.keyboardFocus`) and release on Escape, via a small centralized table (`_keyboardGrabModules` in `shell.qml`) rather than a labwc keybind — a passive hover-peek never grabs focus, only an explicit pin/active session does, so ambient panels never steal input from whatever app you're actually using.
- [ ] **Keyboard navigation for panels** — extend the same exclusive-focus mechanism beyond Escape-to-dismiss: arrow-key/Enter navigation in the calendar's month grid and agenda, eventually MPRIS controls. Same rule applies — only grab focus once a panel is genuinely being driven by keyboard, never during a passive hover-peek.
